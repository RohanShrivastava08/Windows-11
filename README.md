Windows 11 Front Page and Start Menu Recreation Project

Project Overview: In a pursuit of creativity and technical finesse, I embarked on the journey of recreating the iconic Windows 11 front page. Leveraging my expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I meticulously designed an immersive and responsive user interface that mirrors the sleek aesthetics of Windows 11.

Design Excellence: The project boasts a pixel-perfect replica of the Windows 11 front page, capturing every detail with precision. The use of modern design principles and CSS styling techniques results in a visually stunning and user-friendly experience. From the subtle animations to the authentic color palette, every aspect is thoughtfully crafted.

Interactive Start Menu: Taking it a step further, I incorporated an interactive Start Menu using JavaScript. Users can seamlessly navigate through a dynamic menu, mirroring the functionality of the native Windows 11 interface. This added layer of interactivity enhances the overall user experience and showcases my proficiency in front-end development.

Responsive Across Devices: Ensuring a seamless experience across devices, I prioritized responsiveness. The project adapts effortlessly to various screen sizes, maintaining functionality and aesthetics on desktops, laptops, and tablets alike.
